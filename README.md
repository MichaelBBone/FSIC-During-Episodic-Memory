# FSIC-During-Episodic-Memory
code and data repository for "Feature-Specific Neural Reactivation during Episodic Memory"

## Scripts

Contains four R scripts and the required data to run the scripts independently, i.e. the reactivation data can be generated by running FeatSpecifReac.R, but the pregenerated data (ReacRankRecall.RData) is used in FSIC.R and ReacCorVivAcc.R.

The scripts are as follows (see the scripts for more detail):

FeatSpecifReac.R - code for generating feature-specific neural reactivation values

FSIC_Sim.R - code for the neural simulation depicted in Figure 3

FSIC.R - code for FSIC results depicted in Figure 4

ReacCorVivAcc.R - code for the behavioral correlation results depicted in Figure 5


## Data

DNN\<feature level\>ImMat(3X3).mat - matlab data file containing features extracted from VGG16 for all 180 study images. 'feature level' refers to the layer of VGG16 that the features were drawn from. The levels are the last convolution or fully connected layers in each set of layers divided by the max pooling layers. L1 = conv layer 2, L2 = conv layer 4, L3 = conv layer 7, L4 = conv layer 10, L5 = conv layer 13, FC3 = fully-connected layer 3. L2 and L4 were not used in the study. All layers except the fully connected layer were downsampled to 3X3.

DNN\<feature level\>Mix1Mat(3X3)HR.mat - matlab data file containing hemodynamically smoothed features extracted from VGG16 for movie 1.

DNN\<feature level\>Mix2Mat(3X3)HR.mat - matlab data file containing hemodynamically smoothed features extracted from VGG16 for movie 2.
