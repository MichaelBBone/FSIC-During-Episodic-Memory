# FSIC-During-Episodic-Memory
code and data repository for "Feature-Specific Neural Reactivation during Episodic Memory"

## Scripts

Contains four R scripts and the required data to run the scripts independently, i.e. the reactivation data can be generated by running FeatSpecifReac.R, but the pregenerated data (ReacRankRecall.RData) is used in FSIC.R and ReacCorVivAcc.R.

The scripts are as follows (see the scripts for more detail):

FeatSpecifReac.R - code for generating feature-specific neural reactivation values

FSIC_Sim.R - code for the neural simulation depicted in Figure 3

FSIC.R - code for FSIC results depicted in Figure 4

ReacCorVivAcc.R - code for the behavioral correlation results depicted in Figure 5
